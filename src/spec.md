# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the app to SUTRA and update branding by replacing the header logo and browser favicon with SUTRA assets matching the provided reference.

**Planned changes:**
- Update all user-facing naming from “Habitual” to “SUTRA”, including the browser tab title and key UI header/welcome text.
- Add a new generated SUTRA logo image asset (matching the uploaded reference mark) and replace the current header icon with this logo while preserving layout and aspect ratio.
- Add a SUTRA-derived favicon asset and update `frontend/index.html` to reference it so the browser tab displays the SUTRA icon.

**User-visible outcome:** The app shows “SUTRA” in the browser tab and UI headings, displays the new SUTRA logo in the header, and uses the SUTRA favicon in the browser tab.
